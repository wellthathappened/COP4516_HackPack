# Code Style

The code in this repository is meant for print use. So, to minimize space, use the following rules when writing code:

- Use tabs for indentation (width of 4)
- Comments should be placed on column 61 (use spaces)
- Place opening curly braces `{` on the line that opens the block of code
- Place closing curly braces `}` on the last line of the block
- For single-statement `for` and `if` blocks, don't use curly braces at all; put the statement on the same line if it is short enough
- Do not use any blank lines at all
- Almost everything should use `public` modifier
- Private classes should go after the main class
