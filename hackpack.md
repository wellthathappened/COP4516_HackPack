# Hackpack Guidelines

**Deadline for Electronic Submission: May 1, 9:50 AM (via WebCourses)**
**Deadline for Hardcopy Submission: May 1, 10:00 AM (at final contest)**

## Grading Criteria

This will not be specifically divulged, but here are the elements I will look for in the hackpack:

- Good programming contest style (readable but not overly verbose code)
- Written generally (written in such a way that methods are adaptable to a large variety of problem statements)
- Correctness (I may have difficulty judging this but if you provide sample tests, those may help me verify correctness)
- Amount of Material (I expect to see all of the required elements and some other items that you've figured out are useful in contests in general)

***If you use excellent style and implement all of the Required Elements, your team  will earn at least 80% on this assignment. The last 20% is designated for the extra material.***

## Relationship to the Final Team Contest

Your only aids for the final team contest will be one copy of your team's hackpack. Please bring two hard copies of your team's hackpack to Final Team Contest. I will collect one of these copies before the contest begins. You'll have the other copy to use during the contest. You may have no other notes (so none of my lecture notes, etc.) I only want code in the hackpack. What you give me in person must correspond exactly to what you turn in electronically, otherwise an automatic 20% will be deducted.

## Use of Other Code

If you want to use code from online because it's better than yours, please label where you got that code from, but ALSO include your own version and include the version you use as well. Please put these side by side in your printed hackpack, so I can easily see both and compare.

## Repository Guidelines

- Place all contest code in the "code" directory.
- Please use a space-minimizing code style, as outlined in [style.md](style.md)! (ie, don't place curly braces on their own lines, avoid blank lines, etc)
- In the "Required Elements" list below, claim one by putting your name in the sublist below it.
- Place the relevant filename of that code next to your name (eg. Harrison: bellmanford.java)
- Protip: create a link to the file by using: `[Filename.java](code/Filename.java)`
